# JavaScript--Weather-Dashboard-serversideAPI


## Description

<p>This project was created to create an application for Weather Dashboard. It contains notes on HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
<p>I create a Weather Dashboard application with Server-Side APIs that meets certain criteria.</p>
<p>This app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.</p>
<p>I learned how to fetch Server-Side APIs, saving the data in local storage and using the data for code to make the application works dynamically.</p><br>
